Write a program which asks the user, by means of an object of type Scanner, to enter
his/her height (in meters, as double), then the weight (in kilograms, also as a double).
Then the program displays in a message box (JOptionPane.showMessageDialog)
his/her BMI coecient (body mass index ) dened as the weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters  this number should come out close to 20.
